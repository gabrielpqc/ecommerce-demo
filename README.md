An E-Commerce Demo built with React

Using:

- React Router

Overview:
- As part of my personal curiosity towards React, I've decided to create a demo project both for me and for whomever might be interested based on my experience in E-commerce. I decided to create some basic pages present in most E-commerce websites and some features that are usually good UX/Performance wise. As it stands the products are fetched from an external API via fetch API all client side rendered. The goal for the future would be to have this running in a Next.js app to simulate a more realistic environment.
